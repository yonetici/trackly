A modern Google Analytics 4 dashboard and local click heatmap tracker for WordPress with statistical anomaly insights.

== Description ==

MetricPulse is a GDPR-conscious, high-performance plugin that brings Google Analytics 4 reports and local click heatmaps directly to your WordPress website. The admin dashboard covers the metrics that matter: users, sessions, pageviews, engagement rate and average session duration KPIs; a multi-series traffic trend (7 or 30 days); traffic acquisition by source/medium (including referrers) with engagement and key events; traffic-channel and device breakdowns; top pages and top landing pages; top countries; top events; a new-vs-returning split; and a live "last 30 minutes" active-visitor sparkline. It also includes a local click heatmap, standard-deviation based anomaly insights, and a visual GA4 event builder.

All reports are fetched with batched, cached GA4 Data API calls (respecting the API's 5-reports-per-batch limit) and high-cardinality reports are bounded with ordering and row limits to stay within quota.

Introduction and full feature overview: https://www.ridvanbilgin.com/2026/07/metricpulse-wordpress-ga4-analytics-plugin.html

This plugin is designed for strict performance and security. Standard visitors only download a lightweight, vanilla JavaScript tracker under 5KB (with zero jQuery or external dependencies), while the heavier stats overlay interface is loaded exclusively for logged-in administrators. The plugin bundles its own fonts and libraries and makes no third-party front-end requests.

= A note on "insights" =

The anomaly insights are produced by classic descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation over the reporting window), not machine learning. They flag traffic and bounce-rate values that deviate significantly from the recent average.

= External Services Integration =

In compliance with WordPress.org Guidelines, please note that MetricPulse connects to the following external services to deliver its core functionality:

1. **Google Analytics 4 (GA4) API** (https://analyticsdata.googleapis.com)
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves your property's reporting statistics (views, users, bounce rate, sessions, traffic sources, and devices) to display them in interactive charts on the admin dashboard.
   - **Privacy Policy**: Google Privacy Policy can be found at https://policies.google.com/privacy

2. **Cloudflare APIs** (https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4 and https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6)
   - **Purpose**: Dynamically fetches and validates Cloudflare's public IPv4/IPv6 ranges once a week via cron to ensure secure client IP detection and prevent request spoofing.
   - **Privacy Policy**: Cloudflare Privacy Policy can be found at https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy

= Bundled Third-Party Libraries =

* **ApexCharts.js** (v3.41.0, MIT License) — used to render the admin dashboard charts. Source and documentation: https://github.com/apexcharts/apexcharts.js . The library is bundled locally (Admin/js/vendor/apexcharts.min.js); no chart data leaves your server through it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/metricpulse` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Configure your GA4 Property ID and Service Account JSON credentials under the Settings menu, or leave Demo Mode enabled to preview the interface with mock data.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin support IPv6? =
Yes! Cloudflare and reverse proxy whitelists support both IPv4 and IPv6 subnet ranges natively.

= Is the click tracking GDPR-compliant? =
The click telemetry contains no personal data (no IP address, no user identifiers) — only the page path, the clicked element, and normalized click coordinates. It is stored in your own local database and automatically deleted after 30 days. By default the tracker starts in strict opt-in mode and waits for consent from a supported consent plugin (Complianz, Borlabs, CookieLawInfo, or Google Consent Mode v2); you can relax this in Settings.

= What happens to my data when I uninstall? =
By default nothing is deleted, so you can safely reinstall. If you enable "Delete all data on uninstall" in Settings, deleting the plugin will permanently drop the click table and remove all options.

= Do I need Google Analytics installed for the Event Builder? =
Yes. The Event Builder maps clicks to GA4 events via gtag. Your site must already load the GA4 / gtag snippet (for example via Site Kit or a manual tag) for these events to be sent.

== Privacy Policy ==

MetricPulse respects user privacy and complies with GDPR. Telemetry data is recorded locally on custom database tables, contains no personally identifiable information (PII), and is automatically purged after 30 days.
